# Golf Max
This program creates a user profile and then gets the users scores, course rating, and slope rating. It then displays their Handicap Index, and the Average Score Differential if the user wants to see it. (Defintions starting on line 8).

## Motivation üöÄ
I have decided to create this program with the goal of being able to have an app on my phone that simply calculates my Handicap Index when I am on the golf course. It is also a good program to start developping an app with, due to the exciting challenges that it comes with.
