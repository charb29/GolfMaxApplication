# Golf Max
Android application developped with Java. Includes a live score card feature for when you are golfing with friends, or on your own! You have the ability to add new courses, or play featured courses, see your own scores in a leaderboard, and see other user's scores depending on which course you choose. 

## Motivation üöÄ
I have decided to create this program with the goal of being able to have an app on my phone that simply calculates my Handicap Index when I am on the golf course. It is also a good program to start developping an app with, due to the exciting challenges that it comes with.
